# Waybar
If the bar is displaying funky symbols, try installing the fonts Iosevka, FontAwesome and Noto Sans CJK

# Neofetch
The file "neofetch" needs to be in the /usr/bin/ folder for the ascii art to display correctly

Also you need to install lolcat to have the same colors as the image.
You can change the seed at the bottom of the ".bashrc" file
