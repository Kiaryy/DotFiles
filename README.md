# My silly hyprland dot files

### This is mostly for me to get my configs back in case of making a fresh install, feel free of using it if you want tho

# Times i've had to reinstall linux because im dumb: 4

# Waybar
If the bar is displaying funky symbols, try installing the fonts Iosevka, FontAwesome and Noto Sans CJK

# Screensharing
To screen share you will need xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland, and use pulseaudio on pipewire instead of only pulseaudio.

# Neofetch
The file "neofetch" needs to be in the /usr/bin/ folder for the ascii art to display correctly

Also you need to install lolcat to have the same colors as the image.
You can change the seed at the bottom of the ".bashrc" file

# Things to Install
1) hyprpaper (and obviously hyprland)
2) dunst
3) polkit-dumb-agent (very important, you can use any other polkit agent, but i think this one is cool because its very minimal) 
4) waybar
5) kitty
6) cava
7) tty-clock
8) thunar
9) arch linux tweak tool (very useful if u have room temperature iq like me (or if you are very lazy (like me)))
10) paru (you dont need it to install this, but its cool to have)
11) wofi
12) htop (ctrl + shift + esc summons htop, yes im very original)
13) hyprshot (windows + shift + s summons hyprshot, it will only save the screenshot to your clipboard)
14) hyprpicker (not really needed but its good to have)
15) nwg-look
16) xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland
17) pipewire-pulse

### Removing xfce4
sudo pacman -Rns xfce4 xfce4-goodies
